RajendraVidyalaya receives no government or private aid and fees is the only income. Hence fees have to be adjusted from time to time to keep up with rising costs and salaries of the staff.

The school is affiliated to the Council for Indian School Certificate Examination, New Delhi and prepares both boys and girls for the ICSE and ISC examinations conducted by the same Council.

The intellectual education in RV is liberal and universal but at the same time it is Indian and firmly rooted to Indian history and tradition and also follows the norms and suggestions made by the Indian Education Commission.</p>
